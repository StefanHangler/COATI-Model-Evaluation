# COATI-Model-Evaluation
This repository contains all necessary materials and code for replicating the experiments and analyses presented in my report on the COATI model. It includes detailed Jupyter notebooks for training the model from scratch using the GuacaMol dataset, conducting linear probing tasks, and analyzing molecular generation capabilities.
